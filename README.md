## Project Description

A custom object relational mapping (ORM) framework, written in Java, which allows for a simplified and SQL-free interaction with a relational data source. Low-level JDBC is completely abstracted away from the developer, allowing them to easily query and persist data to a data source. Makes heavy use of the Java Reflection API in order to support any entity objects as defined by the developer. Additionally, the framework offers connection pooling to support multi-threaded applications.
